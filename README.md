# Catenc
Category (or label) encoder for the shell written in Rust.

## What is it?

This program translates words to numbers.

In Machine Learning "categories" or "labels" in datasets often need to be encoded to numerical values.

Usually this is done by using something like Scikit-Learn's `sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder` for Python.

Another use-case could be data pseudonymization.

This command line program provides a convenient method to do it on the shell.

## Setup

```
git clone git@github.com:wITTus/catenc.git
cd catenc

cargo build --release

target/release/catenc --help
```

## Example

Suppose you have a dataset like the following:

```
DOG;MALE;4
CAT;FEMALE;6
BIRD;FEMALE;2
DOG;FEMALE;7
DOG;FEMALE;1
CAT;FEMALE;6
DOG;MALE;3
```

### Encode entire lines

```
$ cat PETS | ./catenc
0
1
2
3
4
1
5
```

### Encode the first two of three categories:

```
$ cat PETS | ./catenc -k 1,2 -t';' -T mydict
0;0;4
1;1;6
2;1;2
0;1;7
0;1;1
1;1;6
0;0;3
```

By specifying `-T` we generated a new file `mydict` that contains a mapping from the new to the old values.

```
$ cat mydict | jq .
[
  {
    "2": "BIRD",
    "1": "CAT",
    "0": "DOG"
  },
  {
    "1": "FEMALE",
    "0": "MALE"
  }
]
```

### Features

* Encode to integers as either text or Base64 (`-e`) encoded values
* Encode entire lines or individual columns
* Configurable column separator
* Generate dictionary for later decoding
* Written in Rust ðŸ˜‰
